Some see the Russian attack as just an aberration of Vladimir Putin, Russian president. While thats a part, its not that simple.

And when the Russian people revolted, in 1917, throwing off centuries of repressive Tsarist rule, we invaded Russia to try to abort their revolution  and to keep them in WWI against Germany. We failed. For those who doubt that happened, there are the graves of our Polar Bear doughboys near Detroit.)(../../preprocess/news_crawling/RUS_UKR/p_articles/yahoo.com/Ukraine The Lessons of History.txt)$:0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0)(ukraine+yanukovych+tsarist+nato+militarily+treaty+turmoil+history+polar+jfk+worry+hemisphere+warhead+dominate+end+realize+oppose+lessons+difference+extend+retake+similar+burgess+bad+iron+retire+weve+port+curtain+agree)(ukraine+history+lessons)(0.47622950819672133)(0.75)(0.0021770682148040637)(0.0029006526468455403)(0.0)(20220306)|(0.0)(0.0,0.037037037037037035,0.04878048780487805,0.0)(0.5,0.49567307692307694,0.485828168732507,0.5)(0.5,0.75,0.375,0.5)(0.0,0.014876632801161103,0.0021770682148040637,0.0)(0.0,0.01559100797679478,0.0029006526468455403,0.0)(0.0,0.02631578947368421,0.0,0.0)(0.03615851297619048)(0.006683613960379481)(0.15728821740147395)(0.00714951396779319)(0.007438815706709369)(0.013157894736842105)(0.025233022083944758)(msn.com,menafn.com,yahoo.com,interfax.com.ua)(0.0,1.0,2.0,0.0)(+potentialsolution+thefinlandisation+muddying+start+political+resonance+prospect+precedent+stable+treaty+installation+ukraine+neutrality+memorandum+merkel+nato+order)(0)
