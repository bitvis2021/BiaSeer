By mid-May, export prices for wheat and corn had skyrocketed to unprecedented heights. That has had far-reaching consequences, particularly in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, according to the UN,  countries where the coronavirus pandemic and its fallout had already exacerbated the food situation.   As part of the agreement reached in Turkey, the 20-25 million tons of grain currently blocked in Ukraine could finally be exported.
