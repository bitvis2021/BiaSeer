For the vast majority of Season 4, Part 2, the Byrdes are tasked with getting an imprisoned Navarro off the dreaded SDN list so he can resume his reign as cartel leader. By the end of the series, the SDN list is the only obstacle the Byrdes never surmount, but it changes everything for the show and leads to one of the most pivotal deaths of the series.   After initially refusing to help Schaffer in manipulating elections, Navarro's insistence on being removed from the SDN list in a fraction of the time Wendy proposes it could realistically be done forces her hand. The weight of her ambitions suppresses the voice of her conscience.
