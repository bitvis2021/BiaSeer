His proxies on state media peddle visions of Russia forging a new union encompassing Belarus and Ukraine. And lurking behind it all is a powerful nostalgia  not necessarily for a life under communism, but for what it meant to belong to a globe-straddling power like the Soviet Union.   Others worry that if Putin emerges from the Ukraine war in any way victorious, it could spell trouble for democracies elsewhere.
