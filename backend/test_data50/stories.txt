Russian Tu-95 or Tu-160 strategic bombers were conducting a missile attack from the Caspian region. Approximately 18 missiles from aircraft -ed. were fired, hitting infrastructure facilities in the Dnipropetrovsk, Kirovohrad, Lviv, Vinnytsia, Kyiv and Zakarpattia regions. Missile strikes were also inflicted on the Odesa and Donetsk regions with other means. According to preliminary data, at least 8 cruise missiles were shot down by the Air Defence of the Air Force and the Land Forces on 3 May. This information is being confirmed. There are also reports of 7 drones and one airborne missile being hit." Details: Ihnat draws attention to the fact that the aggressors are sparing their aircraft and helicopters, and abstain from entering the airspace controlled by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Meanwhile, Ukrainian Air Force aircraft conducted dozens of air sorties during the day. Under cover of fighter jets, strike groups carried out about ten missile and bomb strikes at concentrations of aggressor troops, ammunition depots and manpower. +@+ Zgurets: They use a whole range of missiles: air-to-surface cruise missiles, guided ballistic missiles for their Iskander launchers, and long-range Kalibr cruise missiles, launched from ships and submarines.
