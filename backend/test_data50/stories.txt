One of Vladimir Putin's stated justifications for his aggression against Ukraine is the need to remove the "dagger to the throat of Russia" by insisting on Kyiv's neutrality and demilitarisation. Leaving aside, for a moment, the illegality of Russia's use of force in pursuit of this demand and serious doubts about whether Putin can be trusted in any negotiations, what would neutrality entail for Ukraine? To the extent that this can be done on the basis of Putin's pronouncements to date, Ukraine would have to give up its right to join either Nato or the EU, completely demilitarise and not allow foreign for which, read western military bases on what will be left of its territory. Russia's vision of neutrality for Ukraine will also mean a Moscow-friendly government in Kyiv that defers to the Kremlin in both domestic and foreign policies.)(../../preprocess/news_crawling/RUS_UKR/p_articles/russiaherald.com/Why the idea of a neutral Ukraine is a nonstarter in peace talks.txt)$:0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0)(ukraine+nato+neutrality+treaty+demilitarise+finlandisation+memorandum+political+instead+achieve+article+state+stable+interpret+finno+assistance+conditional+order+prospect+current+refrain+end+muddying+existence+extent+mechanism+inherit+agree+price+installation)(ukraine+neutral+peace+talks+idea)(0.49591419816138915)(0.75)(0.014876632801161103)(0.01559100797679478)(0.02631578947368421)(20220228)|#(Ukraine entering crucial period Zelensky tells UK)@:https://www.russiaherald.com/news/272343845/ukraine-entering-crucial-period-zelensky-tells-uk[eventbasecode130][eventcode130](entering,period,zelensky,uk,crucial,)(prime,period,ensure,zelensky,volodymyr,crucial,oligarchs,turn,truss,warn,sunday,hit,secretary,hour,putin,street,ukraine,nato,)(russiaherald.com)(0.7805402545664661)(2022-02-28 00:00:00.0)(On the same day, Truss gave her blessing to Brits to go to Ukraine to fight against Russia - despite being warned that such action would be illegal and dangerous - and said the UK government had "compiled a hit list" of Russian "oligarchs" to sanction.
