"This is happening for one simple reason: the Ukrainian army has started to hit the enemy, and sanctions are starting to hit the Russian economy. Vladimir Putin, apparently, is betting that he needs at least some kind of victory in order to disseminate the information picture from himself in Russia for pseudo-victories on the territory of Ukraine.
