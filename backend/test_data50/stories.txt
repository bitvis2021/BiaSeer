"You always are talking about the risk and how to mitigate your risk and also assessing what your risk is still going to be after your mitigation," Newton says. "Emotionally, it's not just something you talk about. You just wouldn't talk about, 'I'm scared,' or you would just say, 'This is not smart, we're not going to do this.'

Now, with many journalists sharing their heartbreak over Renaud's death and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressing his own "heartfelt condolences" to Renaud's family, Newton says his friend would "hate the fact that people are fawning over him."
