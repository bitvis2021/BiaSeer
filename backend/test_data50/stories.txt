The consequence is that many African countries now face the very real prospect of famine while many Ukrainian farmers have no idea what they are going to do with this year's harvest, given that their silos are still full from last year's crop. As Ukraine and the EU frantically try to find, what diplomats call 'alternative routes', I went to see for myself what's being done to speed up Ukraine's grain and wheat exports. Solidarity, gratitude, bitterness, resentment: the Ukrainian refugee crisis is getting complicated In the muddy woodlands of a Baltic island, Swedens soldiers are getting ready for Russian attack In the Kremlin's crosshairs Reni in Ukraine is one of the only places of its kind still operating in the country and remains a key hub when it comes to exporting Ukrainian corn, wheat and other crops. Driving into the port town, I passed scores of piled-up sandbags and checkpoints. There are big fears here that it could become a target for Russian missiles. For now, the town's main problem remains logistics. The outdated method used to transfer grain to barges, from the trains and trucks that arrive, means the port's authorities are unable to cope with the volume of produce arriving. The result is that some 2000 Ukrainian truck drivers are stuck just outside Reni. I met two of them, Vitalii and his son Bohdan. "Russia is the aggressor, they are to blame, Bohdan told me, while Vitalii said: "The unloading should be better organised. We can handle waiting for three days, but two weeks!? It is so hot! There is a lack of water and toilets." Roman too, another truck driver transporting sun sunflower seeds from the heavily shelled Mykolaiv region, also criticised the slow pace of things: "The problem is due to the delays caused by the barges," he told me. On my arrival in Galati, in Romania, I found workers toiling in blisteringly hot conditions in a bid to repair a railway line - a precious link that could be worth its weight in gold once it is up and running. That's because it's the only place from Ukraine and Moldova, to the EU, with a broad-gauge rail line. Viorica Grecu, a Romanian railway manager told me, "Millions of tonnes of cereal could be exported through this line." Ukraine war: Survivors describe Russian army atrocities in the outskirts of Kyiv The port of Constanta The Romanian port of Constanta is one of the oldest in the world. Despite its age, it's home to probably Europe's most modern grain handling facility. Officials here are working hard to get as much grain as possible from Ukraine out to the rest of the world, but Dan Dolghin, the port's cereals operation manager told me that they're having to wait for new equipment to arrive before they can scale-up capacity. "We need to increase the speed of transhipment at the border and the speed of unloading barges and trains in Constanta Port. To double capacity we need machinery, cranes, pushers, we are talking about 20 million euros. But we need at least two or three months to get it - these two or three months we will have a bottleneck for the Ukrainian goods." Parts of this historic port resemble a scrap yard. As I look around I come across railway tracks from 1939. But rapid change is already underway here, with repair and construction work taking place everywhere. The race against the clock has begun. In Constanta, Galati, Reni, as well as other hubs, the European Union, Romania, Moldova, and Ukraine have a common goal: to build new free trade routes.)(../../preprocess/news_crawling/RUS_UKR/p_articles/msn.com/New routes how is Ukraine getting its grain out.txt)$:1.0,0.0)(ukraine+logistics+blockade+kremlin+transhipment+refugee+war+checkpoint+rail+underway+barge+route+arrive+increase+lack+problem+scrap+hub+grecu+export+wheat+bottleneck+complicate+cope+trade+alternative+gratitude+historic+fourth+million)(ukraine+grain+routes+getting+new)(0.4836193447737909)(0.5)(0.000725689404934688)(0.0014503263234227702)(0.0)(20220715)|#(Zelensky seeks to strengthen Ukraines official ranks as Russian shelling continues)@:https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/zelensky-seeks-to-strengthen-ukraines-official-ranks-as-russian-shelling-continues/ar-AAZHDsL[eventbasecode17][eventcode17](ranks,zelensky,strengthen,ukraines,shelling,)(televise,vadym,solider,zelensky,sbu,intensifies,replace,war,kyiv,maliuk,general,month,shell,putin,job,venediktova,penta,)(msn.com)(0.5710979233962932)(2022-07-18 00:00:00.0)(We will love you forever and ever.

European countries agreed to cuts to natural-gas consumption on Tuesday, prompted by the threat of a Russian supply cutoff.   Meanwhile, the United Nations and Ukrainian officials said the first ships exporting Ukraine grain via the Black Sea under a deal agreed on Friday might set sail in the coming days. Russias naval blockade of Ukraines Black Sea coast has left Ukraine unable to export grain, threatening a major pillar of Ukraines economy and a vital source of global grain supply. +@+ The alert would be the trigger for gas cuts to become mandatory, but some member states with limited links to Europe's power grid  which include islands such as Ireland and relatively remote nations such as Spain  would be exempt.   The announcement by Gazprom that it is further cutting gas deliveries to Europe through Nord Stream 1, for no justifiable technical reason, further illustrates the unreliable nature of Russia as an energy supplier, she said. +@+ The Kremlin is waging an "overt gas war" in an attempt to break Europe's united front over the invasion of Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said after a further squeeze in Russian energy exports.   The EU's storage tanks are about 66 per cent full on average, meaning more gas is needed to reach the commission's target of 80 per cent before winter.)(../../preprocess/news_crawling/RUS_UKR/p_articles/msn.com/Ukraine Calls for More Sanctions in Response to Russias Gas War.txt+../../preprocess/news_crawling/RUS_UKR/p_articles/msn.com/EU strikes deal to cut gas use by 15 amid Russian energy blackmail.txt+../../preprocess/news_crawling/RUS_UKR/p_articles/msn.com/Zelenskyy says Russia waging overt gas war as Gazprom squeezes supplies.txt)$:3.0,0.0)(ukraine+sanctions+kremlin+blockade+war+occupy+prepare+pipeline+escalate+economic+announcement+agreement+zelensky+report+tayyip+avoid+systems+governor+counterpart+long+export+weekend+later+shevchenkove+pretext+make+cutoff+trade+retake+focus#eurozone+putin+strike+compromise+winter+reduce+power+crisis+economic+bloc+gazprom+pipeline+upcoming+grid+vote+prepare+idea+station+volodymyr+der+euphemistically+comparison+forward+mandatory+ryan+end+link+exporter+overshoot+doesnt#ukraine+kremlin+gas+supply+gazprom+pipeline+rouble+zelenskyy+crisis+tactic+nord+winter+reduce+negotiate+prepare+president+unite+grid+station+thursday+continue+perceive+main+meaning+completely+reach+wag+possible+exporter+reason)(ukraine+sanctions+war+gas+calls#ukraine+sanctions+war+gas+calls#ukraine+sanctions+war+gas+calls)(0.48265460030165913+0.48544819557625146+0.4807017543859649)(0.5+0.5+0.5)(0.018867924528301886+0.018867924528301886+0.018867924528301886)(0.019579405366207395+0.019579405366207395+0.019579405366207395)(0.019736842105263157+0.019736842105263157+0.019736842105263157)(20220726+20220726+20220726)|#(Irish president urged to clarify position on Ukraine war following wifes letter)@:https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/newslondon/irish-president-urged-to-clarify-position-on-ukraine-war-following-wifes-letter/ar-AA108ezn[eventbasecode20][eventcode20](clarify,ukraine,irish,urged,president,)(fianna,editorial,zelenskiy,equivalence,previous,sabina,offer,view,world,putin,ukraine,statement,higgins,inbox,irishtimes,write,)(msn.com)(0.5340151075371494)(2022-07-31 00:00:00.0)(Her views are entirely out of touch with those of the Irish people and interventions like this are seen as a tacit endorsement of the Russian regime.
