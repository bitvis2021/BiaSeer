Those with the available resources  like Jos Andrs and World Central Kitchen  quickly mobilized to help those displaced by the war. Meanwhile, others showed their disapproval in more indirect ways: For instance, many states, bar owners, and drinkers began boycotting Russian vodkas.   On that final point, Stolichnaya's modern history can be a bit confusing. The dissolution of the Soviet Union began a still-ongoing debate over whether Stolichnaya remains a Russian state-owned brand or if it became a private entity  and both sides make a version of the vodka. In Russia, Stolichnaya Vodka is state-owned and that "Stoli" will keep the full name. But for most of the rest of the world, the United States included, Stolichnaya Vodka is produced in Latvia by the Luxembourg-based Stoli Group, controlled by the exiled Russian billionaire Yuri Shefler.)(../../preprocess/news_crawling/RUS_UKR/p_articles/msn.com/Stolichnaya Vodka Officially Changes Its Name to Stoli Outside of Russia.txt)$:1.0)(vodka+soviet+ukraine+stolichnaya+rebrand+stoli+yuri+regime+confuse+boycott+dissolution+history+business+global+invasion+announcement+know+group+react+debate+peace+make+version+meaningful+longer+end+month+signature+directly+factor)(stolichnaya+stoli+vodka+officially+changes)(0.4849023090586146)(0.4)(0.001451378809869376)(0.002175489485134155)(0.0)(20220205)|#(French minister says the EU will probably let Ukraine join the pact in a few)@:http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/french-minister-says-the-eu-will-probably-let-ukraine-join-the-pact-in-a-few-years/ar-AAUSWe6[eventbasecode21][eventcode21](probably,pact,ukraine,let,years,)(include,quick,forward,hop,war,versailles,video,union,zelenskyy,month,unanimous,ursula,ukraine,join,make,president,)(msn.com)(0.4702986242412712)(2022-02-08 00:00:00.0)("Indeed over time, they belong to us," von der Leyen told Euronews.
