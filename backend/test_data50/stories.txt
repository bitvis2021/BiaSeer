This will strengthen the international financial isolation of Russia and become an effective tool for maximum counteraction to Russian aggression in the financial sector," the statement reads, as cited by RIA Novosti.   However, SWIFT has alternatives. In Russia, it is the SPFS Financial Message Transfer System, which has similar functionality and allows the transmission of messages in SWIFT format. China, which has no plans to cut ties with Russia, has its own payment system, CIPS Cross-Border Interbank Payment System, while other countries, including India, have been working on setting up payment mechanisms which would allow national currency transactions with Russia.)(../../preprocess/news_crawling/RUS_UKR/p_articles/russiaherald.com/Ukraine wants SWIFT to cut off Russias central bank.txt)$:0.0,1.0,0.0)(ukraine+promsvyazbank+swift+interbank+currency+functionality+global+novosti+vtb+disconnecting+sanction+correspondent+restrict+order+messaging+transfer+alternative+cut+spfs+format+electronic+future+read+rf+military+aggression+agency+freeze+otkritie+include)(ukraine+swift+bank+cut+wants)(0.4842931937172775)(0.65)(0.005805515239477504)(0.006526468455402465)(0.003289473684210526)(20220326)|(0.0)(0.0,0.025,0.0)(0.5,0.4842931937172775,0.5)(0.5,0.65,0.5)(0.0,0.005805515239477504,0.0)(0.0,0.006526468455402465,0.0)(0.0,0.003289473684210526,0.0)(0.019853946427762635)(0.009068328835439126)(0.08660254037844388)(0.0033518157862968117)(0.0037680583195842145)(0.0018991785170711375)(0.014433756729740647)(tass.com,russiaherald.com,dailymail.co.uk)(0.0,1.0,0.0)(+include+read+novosti+vtb+promsvyazbank+global+functionality+interbank+restrict+messaging+otkritie+transfer+sanction+future+ukraine+military+swift+order+spfs)(0)
