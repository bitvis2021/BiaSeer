Turkey should initially provide MCMvessels and also lead this effort, as it is the keeper of theMontreux Convention. Later, additional MCM capability might possibly be provided by non-NATO countries likeEgypt,Saudi Arabiaand Indonesia. These nations should escort the reflagged merchants in Ukrainian waters, while Bulgaria and Romania undertake this role during transit through their waters.
