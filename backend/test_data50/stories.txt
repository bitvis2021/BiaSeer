Russia has blamed the bombing on Ukraine, which has denied involvement. +@+ To find the worst places to be if theres a nuclear attack on America, 247 Wall St. constructed an index consisting of several measures to rank major U.S. cities likely to be targets based on both Schwartzs and Redleners lists. The measures in the index include population density city preparedness for emergency economic significance city preparedness plans distance to the strategic military target proximity to nuclear power plants and ease of evacuation based on commute time as a proxy to congestion and the percentage of a city area that is water. We also added projected fatalities and injuries assuming a 1 megaton bomb, using Nukemap.   To be sure, the nations capital has both a strategic and civilian value, and is therefore one of the most likely targets. Many of the cities on the list may not be the first cities that come to mind as worst to be in case of a nuclear attack, but given the high likelihood they would be hit, at least partially, they make the list. Of course, many more economic centers could be targeted, including Boston, Miami, Atlanta, San Jose, Dallas, and Philadelphia to name a few. An attack on a nuclear plant would also cause devastation. These two events are the worlds worst nuclear accidents.)(../../preprocess/news_crawling/RUS_UKR/p_articles/msn.com/What Is Russias AntiPutin National Republican Army.txt+../../preprocess/news_crawling/RUS_UKR/p_articles/msn.com/The 15 Worst Places To Be in the Event of a Nuclear Attack on the.txt)$:2.0,0.0)(putinism+nra+partisans+russias+army+kyiv+regime+oppose+manifesto+ponomarev+antiputin+invasion+fratricidal+group+investigative+alexander+readiness+kill+join+read+dugina+newsweek+arefight+authorize+utro+unknown+state+telegram+direct+purported#nuclear+nukemap+icbm+preparedness+safer+evacuate+proximity+places+military+devastation+capital+gov+priority+urban+building+neutralize+list+economic+scenario+population+advisor+schwartzs+publish+measure+think+start+large+installation+proxy+sure)(antiputin+russias+army+republican+national#antiputin+russias+army+republican+national)(0.47449768160741884+0.4776119402985075)(0.0+0.0)(0.10849056603773585+0.001451378809869376)(0.10913705583756345+0.002175489485134155)(0.14144736842105263+0.0)(20220822+20220826)|#(Ukraines deRussification fraught with future danger Politico+Ukraine may come to regret deRussification Politico)@:https://www.europesun.com/news/272667759/ukraine-de-russification-fraught-with-future-danger---politico,https://www.europesun.com/news/272668488/ukraine-may-come-to-regret-de-russification--politico[eventbasecode172][eventcode172](regret,future,ukraine,ukraines,politico,)(ukrainian,war,peaceably,version,remove,point,reconcile,piece,reject,ukraine,risk,railway,writes,politico,write,register,notice,)(europesun.com)(0.5280699223268723)(2022-08-26 00:00:00.0)(In January this year, the Politico editor recalled, Human Rights Watch raised concerns about "the lack of protections" for Russian speakers after a new law on language entered into force.
