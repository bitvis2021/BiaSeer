On April 28, 2022, Russian invaders intensified air strikes, air- and sea-based cruise missile strike. Five Kalibr- and Kh-type missiles have been shot down over the past day. The enemy also increased the number of unmanned aerial vehicles UAVs in the Ukrainian air space, which are successfully destroyed by our anti-aircraft defense systems. Nine UAVs were hit, namely seven Orlan-10 UAVs and two unidentified UAVs, the report states. +@+ "Russia stroke Kyiv with cruise missiles right when UN Secretary General antonioguterres and Bulgarian PM KirilPetkov visit our capital. By this heinous act of barbarism Russia demonstrates once again its attitude towards Ukraine, Europe and the world," the head of Ukrainian diplomacy tweeted.   As Ukrinform reported earlier, on Thursday Russian troops attacked the Ukrainian capital with missiles. As a result of the strikes, a 25-storey residential building was partially destroyed and 10 people were injured, according to preliminary reports. +@+ As Ukrinform earlier reported, the Armed Forces of Ukraine destroyed in the southern regions the Russian electronic warfare station Repellent-1, three anti-aircraft guns, the Strela-10 anti-aircraft missile system, as well as a communications vehicle. Also, 42 Russian servicemen were eliminated over the past 24 hours.   There is enough information about this UAV in the public domain. It is a Russian project, but there is almost nothing Russian in Orlan-10, all the "stuffing" is imported from USA, Japan, China, Germany, etc.. The role of this should not be underestimated. "Orlan-10 can perform various tasks, including targeting, serving as a broadcaster or an interference asset. So it poses a serious threat to our troops," the military said.)(../../preprocess/news_crawling/RUS_UKR/p_articles/ukrinform.net/Ukrainian military down 15 enemy air targets.txt+../../preprocess/news_crawling/RUS_UKR/p_articles/ukrinform.net/Kuleba on latest enemy strike targeting Kyiv heinous act of barbarism.txt+../../preprocess/news_crawling/RUS_UKR/p_articles/ukrinform.net/Ukraine forces shoot down ten Russian drones May 1.txt)$:0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0)(ukraine+uavs+russias+aircraft+missile+military+kharkiv+enemy+combat+aerial+hit+destroy+kalibr+correspondent+air+target+ukrinform+kh+type+report+reminder+base+successfully+day+april+su+statement+increase+orlan+total#kyiv+ukraines+kirilpetkov+kuleba+russian+missile+diplomacy+capital+attacked+ukrinform+dmytro+report+troop+visit+target+foreign+heinous+secretary+barbarism+storey+result+act+thursday+twitter+preliminary+issue+building+thats+pm+head#drone+ukraine+reconnaissance+artillery+airspace+armys+enemy+orlan+weapon+range+operate+repellent+destroy+interference+shoot+report+ukrinform+import+broadcaster+depend+read+hour+mainly+earlier+project+small+statement+strela+price+configuration)(ukrainian+targets+15+military+air#ukrainian+targets+15+military+air#ukrainian+targets+15+military+air)(0.47388059701492535+0.46496815286624205+0.47727272727272735)(0.0+0.0+0.0)(0.0021770682148040637+0.000362844702467344+0.05333817126269957)(0.0029006526468455403+0.0010877447425670776+0.05402465554749819)(0.0+0.003289473684210526+0.0625)(20220429+20220429+20220501)|#(Global food crisis is one of Russias intentional goals Kyslytsya)@:https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-economy/3476198-global-food-crisis-is-one-of-russias-intentional-goals-kyslytsya.html[eventbasecode14][eventcode14](crisis,intentional,kyslytsya,food,russias,)(occupy,steal,thursday,war,global,increase,people,illegal,navigation,sanction,sergiy,threaten,statement,ukraine,report,sow,grain,make,order,humanitarian,)(ukrinform.net)(0.6135362550149871)(2022-05-06 00:00:00.0)(Russia has already stolen about 400,000 tonnes of grain within the temporarily occupied areas of Zaporizhzhia Region, Kherson Region, Donetsk Region and Luhansk Region.
