Tens of thousands flee.  Russian President Vladimir Putin says he is launching a "special military operation" to demilitarise and "denazify" Ukraine.

March 2: Russian forces start a siege of the southeastern port of Mariupol, seen as vital to Russian attempts to link the eastern Donbas region with Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula Moscow seized in 2014.  Russian troops reach the centre of the Black Sea port of Kherson, the first large urban centre captured.  One million people have fled Ukraine, the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR says.

April 14: Russia's lead warship in the Black Sea, the Moskva, sinks after what Ukraine says was a missile strike. Russia blames an ammunition explosion.  April 18: Russia launches its eastern assault, unleashing thousands of troops in what Ukraine describes as the Battle of Donbas, a campaign to seize two provinces and salvage a battlefield victory.  April 21: Putin declares Mariupol "liberated" after nearly two months of siege. But hundreds of defenders hold out inside the city's huge Azovstal steelworks.

Kyiv accuses Moscow of staging the attacks to try to widen the conflict.  April 28: Russia fires two missiles into Kyiv during a visit by U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Ukraine says.

We are almost blind because we were in darkness for three months, said Rayisa Rybalko, who hid with her family first in their basement and then in a bomb shelter at the local school before fleeing their village of Novomykhailivka.The world should have seen that.Her son-in-law Dmytro Khaliapin said heavy artillery pounded the village. Houses are being ruined, he said. It's a horror.In Tokyo on Monday, US President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida joined in condemning Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Earlier on his trip to Asia, Biden signed legislation granting Ukraine $40 billion more in US support for its defense against the Russian attack.Polish President Andrzej Duda traveled to Kyiv on Sunday to support Ukraine's European Union aspirations and addressed Ukraine's parliament, receiving a standing ovation when he thanked the lawmakers for letting him speak where the heart of a free, independent and democratic Ukraine beats.Poland has become an important ally of Ukraine, welcoming millions of Ukrainian refugees and becoming a gateway for Western humanitarian aid and weapons and a transit point for some foreign fighters who have volunteered to fight Russian forces.Western support  both financial and military  has been key to Ukraine's defense, helping their outgunned and outnumbered forces to repel Russia's attempt to take the capital of Kyiv and fight them to a standstill in other places.In the face of those setbacks, Moscow has outlined more limited goals in Ukraine, with its sights now on trying to expand the territory that Russia-backed separatists have held since 2014.Ukrainian forces dug in around Sievierodonetsk, the main city under Ukrainian control in the Luhansk province of the Donbas, as Russia intensified efforts to capture it. Gov. Serhiy Haidai accused the Russians of simply intentionally trying to destroy the city ... engaging in a scorched-earth approach.Haidai said Sunday that the Russians had occupied several towns and cities in Luhansk after indiscriminate, 24-hour shelling and concentrating forces and weaponry there, bringing in troops from Kharkiv to the northwest, Mariupol to the south, and from inside Russia.But the Ukrainian military said that Russian forces were unsuccessful in their attack on Oleksandrivka, a village outside of Sievierodonetsk.Ukraine's parliament voted Sunday to extend martial law and mobilize its armed forces for a third time, until Aug. 23.Ukrainian officials have said little since the war began about the extent of their country's casualties, but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Sunday that 50 to 100 Ukrainian fighters were being killed, apparently each day, in the east.While the east is now the focus of flighting, the conflict is not confined there. Powerful explosions were heard early Monday in Korosten, about 160 kilometers west of Kyiv, the town's deputy mayor said.It was the third straight day of apparent attacks in the Zhytomyr District, Ukrainian news agencies reported.In other developments, Ukraine's first lady, Olena Zelenska, gave a rare interview to national broadcaster ICTV alongside her husband and said she has hardly seen him since the war began.Our family, like all Ukrainian families, is now separated, she said.Zelenskyy called the interview itself a date on air, and the couple, who have two children, joked in front of the journalists.We are joking, but we are really waiting, like everyone else, to be reunited, like all families in Ukraine who are separated now, waiting for their relatives and friends who want to be together again, he said.
