The defence ministry said in a statement that a fire erupted around 6:15 am local time 0315 GMT at a temporary military storage site near the village of Mayskoye in the Dzhankoi district, causing ammunition to detonate. Images posted on social media showed huge fireballs erupting at the site and clouds of black smoke billowing into the air. The ministry said no one had been seriously injured and that work was underway to determine the cause of the fire. Crimea's Moscow-appointed governor Sergei Aksyonov, who went to the site, said two civilians had been injured but that their lives were not at risk. Local officials told Russian news agencies that some 2,000 people were evacuated from the area as a precaution. Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 in the wake of massive nationwide street demonstrations in Ukraine that led to the ouster of a Kremlin-friendly president. Those protests precipitated fighting between the army and Moscow-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, which laid the groundwork for Moscow's full-scale assault on February 24 this year. On August 9, Moscow said ammunition had detonated at a military airfield in Crimea, killing one person and wounding several more. It indicated that the airfield was not targeted by Ukrainian forces but experts said satellite imagery pointed to a likely attack, with several Russian warplanes destroyed. Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for any attacks in Crimea but officials have made several comments suggesting its forces could be involved.

Russia has blamed the bombing on Ukraine, which has denied involvement. +@+ To find the worst places to be if theres a nuclear attack on America, 247 Wall St. constructed an index consisting of several measures to rank major U.S. cities likely to be targets based on both Schwartzs and Redleners lists. The measures in the index include population density city preparedness for emergency economic significance city preparedness plans distance to the strategic military target proximity to nuclear power plants and ease of evacuation based on commute time as a proxy to congestion and the percentage of a city area that is water. We also added projected fatalities and injuries assuming a 1 megaton bomb, using Nukemap.   To be sure, the nations capital has both a strategic and civilian value, and is therefore one of the most likely targets. Many of the cities on the list may not be the first cities that come to mind as worst to be in case of a nuclear attack, but given the high likelihood they would be hit, at least partially, they make the list. Of course, many more economic centers could be targeted, including Boston, Miami, Atlanta, San Jose, Dallas, and Philadelphia to name a few. An attack on a nuclear plant would also cause devastation. These two events are the worlds worst nuclear accidents.)(../../preprocess/news_crawling/RUS_UKR/p_articles/msn.com/What Is Russias AntiPutin National Republican Army.txt+../../preprocess/news_crawling/RUS_UKR/p_articles/msn.com/The 15 Worst Places To Be in the Event of a Nuclear Attack on the.txt)$:2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0)(putinism+nra+partisans+russias+army+kyiv+regime+oppose+manifesto+ponomarev+antiputin+invasion+fratricidal+group+investigative+alexander+readiness+kill+join+read+dugina+newsweek+arefight+authorize+utro+unknown+state+telegram+direct+purported#nuclear+nukemap+icbm+preparedness+safer+evacuate+proximity+places+military+devastation+capital+gov+priority+urban+building+neutralize+list+economic+scenario+population+advisor+schwartzs+publish+measure+think+start+large+installation+proxy+sure)(antiputin+russias+army+republican+national#antiputin+russias+army+republican+national)(0.47449768160741884+0.4776119402985075)(0.0+0.0)(0.10849056603773585+0.001451378809869376)(0.10913705583756345+0.002175489485134155)(0.14144736842105263+0.0)(20220822+20220826)|(0.0029555261812994355)(0.017857142857142856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0)(0.4760548109529632,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5)(0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5)(0.05497097242380261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0)(0.0556562726613488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0)(0.07072368421052631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0)(0.015183656232712943)(0.009775582493286788)(0.0)(0.022441805517153572)(0.022721578167586284)(0.028872823174253468)(0.007290148043997554)(msn.com,yahoo.com,dw.com,menafn.com,onenewspage.com,indiatimes.com)(2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0)(+safer+putinism+schwartzs+utro+proxy+readiness+unknown+scenario+read+proximity+regime+urban+publish)(0)
