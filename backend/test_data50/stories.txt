The war in the Russian breakaway republic of Chechnya from 1994 to 1996 was in many ways the starting point. Russia's defeat there showed how far the country had fallen, leading many former Soviet republics to part ways with Russia. Moscow responded by systematically undermining neighboring states like Moldova, Georgia and Azerbaijan through the incitement of ethnic conflicts on their territories - a classic divide-and-rule tactic.   For a time, Moscow tried other tactics. Pro-Russian politician Viktor Yanukovych managed to get elected as president of Ukraine in 2010, but his misrule led to the popular uprising of 2013. That event, in turn, showed that the Ukrainian people saw Europe, rather than Russia, as their future. Putin responded by annexing Crimea and starting a war in eastern Ukraine. At home, Putin's rhetoric became increasingly nationalistic, and now focused on concepts such as the "Russian world" in order to foment a divide between Russia and an allegedly decadent West.)(../../preprocess/news_crawling/RUS_UKR/p_articles/msn.com/No the war in Ukraine is not about NATO.txt)$:1.0,0.0)(crimea+nato+russians+gorbachev+war+imperialist+regime+expand+orthodox+change+rhetoric+strategic+crisis+undermine+news+elect+future+end+expertise+breakaway+order+function+say+include+state+basis+incorrect+program+largely+central)(nato+ukraine+war)(0.477360931435)(0.55)(0.0050798258345428155)(0.005801305293691081)(0.003289473684210526)(20220309)|#(Russia says Ukraine neutrality key at conflict talks What does it mean and could it)@:https://www.msn.com/en-in/news/world/russia-says-ukraine-neutrality-key-at-conflict-talks-what-does-it-mean-and-could-it-help-to-achieve-peace/ar-AAV8YNI[eventbasecode46][eventcode46](talks,peace,ukraine,neutrality,key,)(note,nation,katharine,neutral,kyiv,war,ukraines,long,room,renounces,view,putin,pledge,interfere,enshrine,wording,nato,status,)(msn.com)(0.4602443769657009)(2022-03-16 00:00:00.0)(Countries like Switzerland, Sweden, Ireland, Finland and Austria have pledged neutrality.

In advance of the talks both sides sounded more optimistic than before, but the cause for their optimism was unclear.   The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, is pressing for a direct meeting with Putin. France, the UK and the US remain sceptical that Russia is yet willing to negotiate a settlement that the Ukrainian leadership would find acceptable. +@+ According to Ukraine, around 20,000 volunteers from 52 countries have signed up to join the international legion. These foreign fighters can wear the Ukrainian uniform and get a citizenship. This is to make sure that if captured by Russian forces, they will be treated as per the Geneva Conventions of war.   Wali holds the record of the longest confirmed kill  he shot down an ISs fighter in Iraqs Mosul from a distance of 3.5 kilometre using a McMillan Tac-50 rifle in June 2017. +@+ He also said that he hopes peace talks between Ukraine and Russia will lead to some results.   In particular we believe its imperative that humanitarian corridors, genuine humanitarian corridors are created, maintained and sustained as quickly as possible. +@+ Its understood Mr Martin told President Zelenskyy that everyone in Ireland admired his great leadership in the face of an immoral war on the people of Ukraine.   Its understood President Zelenskyy was very appreciative of support from Ireland, the visa waiver, St Patricks Day show of solidarity, 20m aid and other contributions to the EU peace facility. +@+ AUGUSTA, Maine WABI - We spoke to both Senators Susan Collins and Angus King today about President Zelenskyys speech.   Zelenskyy galvanized the entire room of members of congress, said Sen. Susan Collins. He was so impassioned, he was so strong. And we know that he is the number one target of the Russians. I think we should respond to his call for action, with the exception of that no-fly zone which could lead to a very broad war in Europe. But other than that, I thought what he asked for was reasonable and much needed. +@+ "Around 10:30 a.m. the CV-17 appeared around 30 nautical miles to the southwest of Kinmen, and was photographed by a passenger on a civilian flight," a source familiar with the issue told Reuters.   Taiwan's Ministry of Defense also confirmed the incident, giving no details but saying they know the "full grasp" of China's actions in the Taiwan Strait. +@+ If theres just 1 chance for us to stop this war, I think that we need to take this chance, said Zelensky.   Zelensky has repeatedly called for a direct meeting with Putin over the last month, most recently saying its time for the two to meet in a Saturday video address. Sunday isnt the first time Zelensky has invoked a warning about World War III, either, as he told NBC News on Wednesday a world war may have already started. Russian and Ukrainian delegations have held multiple rounds of peace talks without any major progress thus far. On Tuesday, Zelensky indicated a willingness to concede on a key Russian demand Tuesday, saying Ukraine must accept it will not be able to join NATO, though Ukraine has maintained it wont agree to Russias demand of Ukraine becoming a neutral country like Austria and Sweden.)(../../preprocess/news_crawling/RUS_UKR/p_articles/msn.com/Russian former foreign minister calls for Ukraine ceasefire.txt+../../preprocess/news_crawling/RUS_UKR/p_articles/msn.com/He can kill 40 in a day Meet the worlds deadliest sniper who has joined.txt+../../preprocess/news_crawling/RUS_UKR/p_articles/msn.com/Irish Government doing everything it can to find accommodation for Ukrainians.txt+../../preprocess/news_crawling/RUS_UKR/p_articles/msn.com/Taoiseach urged to keep pressure on Russia in phone call with Ukrainian President.txt+../../preprocess/news_crawling/RUS_UKR/p_articles/msn.com/Maine Senators react to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyys address.txt+../../preprocess/news_crawling/RUS_UKR/p_articles/msn.com/Chinese aircraft carrier sails through Taiwan Strait ahead of Biden Xi call.txt+../../preprocess/news_crawling/RUS_UKR/p_articles/msn.com/Zelensky Again Warns Of World War If Talks With Russia Fail.txt)$:7.0,0.0)(ceasefire+diplomacy+ukraine+yeltsin+putins+ivanov+nuclear+negotiator+president+firefight+resign+appoint+reminder+military+pursue+marginalise+recep+acceptable+end+say+publish+issue+believe+step+bilateral+dmytro+reduce+year+welcome+olaf#ukrainian+soldier+kill+molotov+surveillance+zelenskyys+iraqs+kandahar+citizenship+know+mlanie+chopper+cbc+iss+join+reality+world+suit+clarify+hed+type+th+deliver+sure+alongside+far+glad+reportedly+little+renovate#ukraine+demilitarisation+refugee+politics+irish+taoiseach+accommodation+peace+instability+unilaterally+broader+dramatic+consequences+directive+future+increase+turning+significant+world+idea+scrpv+degree+require+population+martin+arrive+vat+measure+proof+inbox#ukraine+taoiseach+zelenskyy+irish+peace+biden+volodymyr+journalist+aid+news+kill+visa+speak+martin+thursday+great+continue+pressure+high+admire+minute+hop+immoral+mr+people+phone+facility+house+face+offer#ukraine+putin+zelenskyy+congress+attack+compromise+remind+impassioned+freedom+speak+military+know+sen+harbor+lead+strong+isnt+plan+principally+today+fly+galvanize+academic+signal+collins+th+weve+zone+sort+wabi#taiwan+warship+reuters+icbm+transit+flight+biden+xi+southwest+talk+conduct+invasion+spokesperson+ahead+lijian+friday+jinping+time+foreign+know+tension+training+tucker+issue+strait+include+test+reuter+grasp+state#putin+zelensky+nato+ceasefire+war+ukraine+negotiate+volodymyr+meeting+mediator+soon+warns+tayyip+agreement+wont+translation+isnt+world+end+hopeful+envoy+ready+watch+nbc+cnns+kurt+invoke+realisticheres+multiple+emerge)(ukraine+ceasefire+russian+minister+calls#ukraine+ceasefire+russian+minister+calls#ukraine+ceasefire+russian+minister+calls#ukraine+ceasefire+russian+minister+calls#ukraine+ceasefire+russian+minister+calls#ukraine+ceasefire+russian+minister+calls#ukraine+ceasefire+russian+minister+calls)(0.47637051039697537+0.46949602122015915+0.4891451831750339+0.5125448028673836+0.5020746887966805+0.49373040752351094+0.4876847290640394)(0.85+0.85+0.85+0.85+0.85+0.85+0.85)(0.07256894049346879+0.05406386066763425+0.16364296081277213+0.010159651669085631+0.102322206095791+0.018867924528301886+0.001451378809869376)(0.06490210297316897+0.05003625815808557+0.16098622189992748+0.010877447425670777+0.07940536620739666+0.019216823785351705+0.002175489485134155)(0.08552631578947369+0.09210526315789473+0.3684210526315789+0.009868421052631578+0.08552631578947369+0.029605263157894735+0.003289473684210526)(20220314+20220314+20220316+20220316+20220316+20220318+20220320)|(0.22802784629131792)(0.06666666666666667,0.0)(0.49014947757768335,0.5)(0.8499999999999999,0.5)(0.06043956043956044,0.0)(0.05537138713353361,0.0)(0.0963345864661654,0.0)(0.07526712373584114)(0.006965371203050243)(0.24748737341529153)(0.04273722303874738)(0.03915348332582717)(0.06811883935302736)(0.04714045207910317)(msn.com,bbc.com)(7.0,0.0)(+year+russiaukraine+thermobaric+supply+reuters+truncate+zone+yeltsin+preliminary+pentagon+order+realize+versa+zelenskiy+zelenskyys+warship+occur+wabi+vat+wont+russias+zelenskyy+port+true+western+send+potentially+virtual+increased+troop+weve+world+sanction+underway+victim+worried+surround+resume+zelensky+volodymyr+telegram+thursday+war+stay+soldier+watch+short+sinehubov)(0)
